My Puppet Configs
=================

Nobody should be under any illusion that these are some indication of Puppet best practice, in fact, they very obviously do any number of really ugly things that should never see the light of day in a production enviroment.

I do however find them useful and they work perfectly well for quickly rebuilding dev boxes with various configurations and stop me forgetting key steps and getting frustrated.
